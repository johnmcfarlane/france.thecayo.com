<h1>Other Recreation</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>

<h2>Tourist Office</h2>
<p>
	In St. Palais opposite "Gersoise" estate agents. 
	Free maps of the area and other information, local events, entertainment, etc. 
	We recommend you also ask for a tide table so that you can plan around high and 
  low tides (the table is more accurate than the Tide Clock in the apartment and 
  also gives the coefficients which determine the size of the tides). In season 
  there is also an office by La Grande Côte.
</p>

<h2>Coastal Path</h2>
<p>
	The path is opposite the apartment. A wonderful walk when 
	the tide is in (out of season when it is not too hot) is to follow it all the 
	way round to St. Palais. You pass first the "Puits de l'Auture" and then after 
	the Plage du Platin, the "Pont du Diable", spectacular natural forms eroded 
	by the sea. If there is a swell and the tide is in, the result is amazing. Keep 
	any small children under surveillance near these features when it is rough. 
</p>

<p>To the North, the path takes you into the Forest adjacent to Plage de la Grand Côte.</p>

<h2>Beaches</h2>

<p>
	There are plenty of these. Within walking distance are 
	<a href="../pictures/grande_plage">Plage de la Grand Côte</a> (enormous) and 
	<a href="../pictures/plage/du_platin">Plage du Platin</a> (pretty, but beware submerged sharp rocks), both of which are 
	supervised during the more popular parts of the year. The <a href="../pictures/opposite">beach 
	opposite</a> the apartment (which disappears at high tide) is fine for paddling 
	and sun bathing but is not recommended for swimming because of currents. The 
	rock pools are good fun.
</p>

<p>
	Although these beaches are "clean", large quantities of tree trunks 
	and other debris are deposited at the high tide line by stormy weather in winter. 
	Presumably these are carried out from the Dordogne and Garonne and make a walk 
	along the shore interesting to say the least. The local authorities clean these 
	up prior to the popular periods.
</p>

<p>There are occasional visits by jelly-fish which are a bit unsightly but not poisonous. </p>

<h2><a href="../pictures/misc">Parc de Loisir</a></h2>
<p>
	About a mile or so from the apartment, this has mini-golf, tennis, boating &amp; fishing with walks around the lake.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.zoo-palmyre.fr" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">Zoo</a></h2>
<p>
	At Palmyre to the North. We have not visited this yet but it is said to be the 
	best in France. The website is certainly great fun. It is open all year between 
	09.00 and 18.00 (19.00 summer). Admission adults &euro;13.00, children (3-12) &euro;9.00 (2005 rates).
</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.golfderoyan.com" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">Golf Club</a> and Equestrian Centre:</h2>
<p> 
	The <a href="../pictures/golf_course">Golf Course</a> plays really well, especially 
	if you can hit straight. There are lots of mature trees and it is generally 
	interesting and picturesque. It is open all year round with preferential green 
	fees for the "Basse Saison" (12 November ‘98 to 14 March ‘99) and 
	&quot;Moyenne Saison&quot; (mid March to end June and September to mid November). 
	If you book through Les Fallaises as a customer, M Allias can get you a 20% 
	discount off the green fees. Food at the Golf Cub is also good (lunches only, 
	best to book Tel 40 80). There are some comments on the course <a href="http://www.golfeurope.com/euro_clubs/royan/index.htm" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">here</a>.
</p>

<p>We do not yet know much about the Equestrian Centre.</p>

<h2>Musée de La Poche de Royan</h2>
<p>
	Highly recommended, especially if you are interested in the history of the last war in France or 
	if you have children. This is situated in the out of town shopping area, the 
	"Carrefour des Affaires" at Le Gua on the intersection of the road to Rochefort 
	(D733) with the road from Saujon to Marennes (D1/D131). According to the proprietor, 
	it is excluded from the Royan area for political reasons. This museum explains 
	why there are so many strange German concrete fortifications on this stretch 
	of coast (now preserved as archaeological sites) and perhaps why in Britain 
	we never hear of the bizarre events that took place here at the end of the last 
	world war.
</p>

<p> 
	If you are interested in local history, a local author (Jean Nappé) has written 
	"Histoire de SAINT-PALAIS-SUR MER", ISBN 2-84327-020-0, available from the paper 
	shop opposite La Gersoise (160FRF). You can read how the coastline has changed 
	so dramatically since Roman times and about the landing of 2000 troops from 
	British ships on the beach up the road on 8 April1814. There is a prize for 
	anyone who can tell us the origin of the name "Pointe de Terre-Nègre ou des 
	Fourneaux", the former name of the rocky outcrop on which Le Petit Poucet sits. 
</p>

<h2>Phare de Cordouan</h2> 
<p>
	The visit to the famous 16th century Phare de Cordouan 
	is really exciting. This is the lighthouse that you see from the terrace (there 
	is also a large framed photograph of it in the bedroom. The construction took 
	27 years from 1584 to 1611. Originally it was a combined chapel, royal residence 
	and fortress on a base 41 m in diameter on a small island (with dunes) in the 
	estuary. Total height was 37 m. The "Appartement du Roi" is on the 1st floor 
	and the chapel, "Notre Dame de Cordouan" (with stained glass windows), forms 
	the second floor. Local stone was used and the effect on the cliffs can still 
	be seen, e.g. at Pont de Diable. Its constructor, Charles de Foix died in 1602, 
	before it was finished. In 1788 two more floors were added, doubling the height 
	to 67.5 m. Two different boat firms sail from Royan harbour; days and times 
	depend upon the tides (total trip takes up to 5 hours). You will get your legs 
	wet up to your knees getting on and off the sand dunes so shorts are a good 
	idea as is synthetic (i.e. sea-proof) footwear for the rocky bits. Take your 
	own refreshments. 
</p>

<h2>Chemin de fer touristique de la Seudre</h2>
<p>
	This little tourist train runs 
	(at a very leisurely pace!) from June to September from Saujon to La Tremblade 
	and back. This is a very relaxing way to see the countryside, wildlife and famous 
	oyster beds of the Seudre estuary and salt marshes. Time it so that you can 
	have lunch in La Tremblade in one of the many excellent seafood restaurants. 
	Some of the carriages are open so take a sun hat and sun cream. There should 
	be a brochure in the Visitors Folder. a brochure in the Visitors Folder.
</p>

<h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>
	M. Allias (Les Fallaises) runs deep sea fishing trips. 
	In 2000 he charged FRF400 (ie about &euro;60), which included the hire of all equipment 
	and you get to keep the fish. He can also arrange fishing from the beach or 
	rocks if you prefer.
</p>

<h2>Other Excursions</h2>
<p>
	The 13th century Romanesque church at Vaux sur Mer 
	(one of many in the area) is just a few miles away. The 12th century town of 
	Talmont (~ 15 km south of Royan) is worth a visit - its pretty little streets 
	contain lots of craft shops. Immediately to the south, near Barzan, is the impressive 
	pre-historic and Gallo-Romanic site of Le F‚. Mornac-sur-Seudres, a few kilometres 
	north of St. Palais is also picturesque and full of local craft shops. There 
	is a wonderful market at Saujon on the second Monday of each month which seems 
	to occupy most of the town in the morning. A bit further afield are Blaye (impressive 
	fortress), the fortified town of Brouage, Saintes (capital of the Cognac area) 
	as well as Cognac itself, many naval attractions and a "Transporter" bridge 
	at Rochefort and the popular tourist island, Ile d'Oléron. Also at Rochefort, 
	a visit to "La Cordèrie" is fascinating, a peculiarly long building where rope 
	for the French navy was made using ingenious old machines. Nearby, they are 
	reconstructing the famous ship of La Fontayne, "L'Hermione", which 
	played a key part in helping the American insurgents in their rebellion against 
	the British crown - well worth a visit. They plan to sail the replica to Boston 
	when it is finished. You can also take the car ferry from Royan ("Le Bac" - 
	a bit expensive) from Royan across to the famous Medoc vineyards and chateaux. 
</p>

<p>
	In season there are various boat trips in addition to the trip to the Phare 
	de Courduan described above -for information on these see brochures in Visitors' 
	Folder or ask at <a href="http://www.saint-palais-sur-mer.com" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">Tourist Office</a>. 
</p>

<p>
	There is also a Diary of Events available <a href="http://www.charente-maritimeguide.com/00_tourism/char_mari_guide/pages_03/charm_date_events_03.htm#top" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">here</a>.
