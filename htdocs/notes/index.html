 </b></span><span lang="en-GB">The metal fuse box is on the wall by
the entrance door.  If the electricity has been switched off, you
will need to turn on the main switch and the switches on the fuses
for both Heating and Hot Water (labelled).  The latter is best set on
night (a moon symbol) unless you are using a lot of hot water during
the day in which case switch temporarily to day (a sun symbol). The
night time rate (22.30 - 06.30) is almost half the price of the
daytime rate.</span></font></font></p>

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">There
are spare fuses in a bottle in this cupboard.  Spare light bulbs are

<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Unless
there are visitors expected within a day or two of the previous
tenants, the fridge is normally defrosted, left empty and switched
off with the door open.</font></font></p>

can be seen behind the controls.</font></font></p>

 </b></span><span lang="en-GB">If the water is off, there is a small
tap to the LHS of the base of the hot water tank in the cupboard and
another on to the cistern of the toilet.  If there is still no water,
then the mains has been turned off.  </span></font></font>

<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
mains stopcock is located in the third cupboard from the left at the
bottom of the stairs.  You need a screwdriver (there is one in the
fuse box cupboard) to open the door.  The tap and meter are clearly
marked as No 8. </font></font>

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
there is a stale water/drains smell on entering the apartment, this
is almost certainly because water in a u-bend below the water tank
has dried out.  To replenish the u-bend and eliminate this problem,
open the tap below the tank briefly.</font></font></p>

<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Across
the road is “Les Viviers Charentais” which sells excellent fresh
seafood (prepared as a take-away) as well as other items.  Adjacent
to this they have a stall selling sandwiches and hot and cold snacks
to take away.  In the winter they are only open at the weekends. 
There is also a bread shop called Vincent that is open May to
September opening times vary.  There are other seasonal shops nearby.</font></font></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Out
of season you will need to go into St. Palais (about 1¼ miles) where
there are plenty of shops including a good self-service store called
“Casino” which is like a mini supermarket.  The market is open
every day (even in winter) from 9am - 1pm selling the best local
produce, including fresh seafood. The best days are usually Tuesday,
Thursday &amp; Saturday</font></font></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><br/>

</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Cooking
facilities in the kitchenette are limited which provides an ideal
excuse for the “cook” to take advantage of the many low cost
take-away opportunities.  As well as “Les Viviers” and the snack
bar opposite, there are several small shops in St. Palais selling hot
and cold take-away snacks.  Our favourite, for roast chicken, is
“Rotisserie Saintongeaise” (Tel 11 99). </font></font>

nearest </span><span lang="en-GB"><b>supermarket</b></span><span lang="en-GB">
is SUPER-U on the north side of St. Palais (just over a mile away via
the D141), which we find adequate for most items.  INTERMARCHÉ on
this side of Royan at Vaux is cheaper and more comprehensive and
LECLERC on the Saintes road out of Royan is bigger again.  All are
well signposted.  </span></font></font>

supervised during the more popular parts of the year. The beach
opposite the apartment (which disappears at high tide) is fine for

of currents.  However, quite a few of our guests swim there regularly
and come back year after year!  The rock pools are good fun.</span></font></font></p>

these beaches are “clean”, large quantities of tree trunks and

<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
you are interested in local history, a local author (Jean Nappé) has
written “Histoire de SAINT-PALAIS-SUR MER”, ISBN 2-84327-020-0,
available from the paper shop opposite La Gersoise (160FRF). You can
read how the coastline has changed so dramatically since Roman times
and about the landing of 2000 troops from British ships on the beach
up the road on 8 April 1814.  There is a prize for anyone who can
tell us the origin of the name “Pointe de Terre-Nègre ou des
Fourneaux”, the former name of the rocky outcrop on which Le Petit
Poucet sits.  </font></font>

de Cordouan</b></span><span lang="en-GB">:</span><span lang="en-GB"> 
</span><span lang="en-GB">The visit to the famous 16th century Phare
de Cordouan is really exciting.  This is the lighthouse that you see
from the terrace (there is also a large framed photograph of it in
the bedroom). The construction took 27 years from 1584 to 1611.
Originally it was a combined chapel, royal residence and fortress on
a base 41 m in diameter on a small island (with dunes) in the
estuary.  Total height was 37 m. The “Appartement du Roi” is on
the 1st floor and the chapel, “Notre Dame de Cordouan” (with
stained glass windows), forms the second floor. Local stone was used
and the effect on the cliffs can still be seen, e.g. at Pont de
Diable.  Its constructor, Charles de Foix died in 1602, before it was
finished.  In 1788 two more floors were added, doubling the height to
67.5 m.  Two different boat firms sail from Royan harbour; days and
times depend upon the tides (total trip takes up to 5 hours).  You
will get your legs wet up to your knees getting on and off the sand
dunes so shorts are a good idea as is synthetic (i.e. sea-proof)
footwear for the rocky bits.  Take your own refreshments.</span></font></font></p>

little tourist train runs (at a very leisurely pace!) from June to
September from Saujon to La Tremblade and back. This is a very
relaxing way to see the countryside, wildlife and famous oyster beds
of the Seudre estuary and salt marshes. Time it so that you can have
lunch in La Tremblade in one of the many excellent seafood
restaurants.  Some of the carriages are open so take a sun hat and
sun cream.  Also, we have been told by friends who have been on the
train more recently than us that there is now a steam engine and the
day they went they were showered with black smuts so beware. There

church at Vaux sur Mer (one of many in the area) is just a few miles
away.  The 12th century town of Talmont  (~ 15 km south of Royan) is
worth a visit - its pretty little streets contain lots of craft
shops.  Immediately to the south, near Barzan, is the impressive
pre-historic and Gallo-Romanic site of Le Fâ.  Mornac-sur-Seudres, a
few kilometres north of St. Palais is also picturesque and full of
local craft shops. There is a wonderful market at Saujon on the
second Monday of each month which seems to occupy most of the town in
the morning.</span></font></font></p>

town of Brouage, Saintes (capital of the Cognac area) as well as
Cognac itself, many naval attractions and a “Transporter” bridge
at Rochefort and the popular tourist island, Ile d’Oléron.  Also
at Rochefort, a visit to “La Cordèrie” is fascinating, a
peculiarly long building where rope for the French navy was made
using ingenious old machines.  Nearby, they are reconstructing the
famous ship of La Fontayne, “L’Hermione”, which played a key
part in helping the American insurgents in their rebellion against
the British crown – well worth a visit. They plan to sail the
replica to Boston when it is finished.</font></font></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align="left"><font face="Ariel"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You

the terrace, it should remain relatively cool during the heat of

that, should the evening get cool, it will still be comfortable to
use the terrace for evening meals, drinks or just sitting watching
the world go by.  However, this is on the coast and, even in mid
summer, there is always the possibility of a sudden change in the
weather. Therefore, the awning must always be left in the closed
position at night, at any time when there is a risk of strong winds
or whenever you leave the apartment. To leave the awning out in
strong winds would not only result in damage to the awning but could
also pose a risk to other people and property. Turn the handle

favourite route from Portsmouth to St Malo requires that we need a
stopover on the return journey.  Sometimes we stay there a few days –
there are lots of places to visit within a short drive, not least
