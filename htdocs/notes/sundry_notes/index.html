<h1>Sundry Notes</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<span class="bold">Some emergency numbers:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The Royan General <span class="bold">Hospital</span> is on 
			the south side of Vaux-sur-Mer at 20 ave Saint Sordelin, Tel 05 46 39 52 52 
			(emergencies 05 46 39 52 18).
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a <span class="bold">doctor's</span> surgery (Cabinet 
			Seigneurin) not far from the pharmacie at 34 ave République in St Palais, 
			Tel 05 46 23 20 79
		</li>
		<li>
			and a <span class="bold">dentist</span> (Mestre) at 11 rue Henri Neaud, Tel 
			05 46 23 12 55.
		</li>
	</ul>
	There is a more complete list of emergency numbers in the 
			Visitors' Folder.
</li>

<li>
	The <span class="bold">washing machine</span> instructions (+ all other appliance instructions) 
    are in a maroon folder in the pine cupboard. If you need to wash the white 
    seat covers, please do not do this on a hot wash above 50°C. 
</li>

<li>
	The radio of the <span class="bold">Hi-Fi</span> has been preset as has the<span class="bold"> TV</span> (see 
    separate sheet in Visitors' Folder). Please do not change these presets (even 
    if you have small children to do it for you!). To gain access to the cassette 
    recorder, the bottom front panel pulls down (where it says "DIGITAL"). You 
    can't get a decent BBC Radio 4 long wave (198 kHZ) signal on this radio - 
    reception is best with a suitable portable on the breakfast bar. To get decent 
    FM reception you will need to arrange the position of the aerial wire. The 
    TV will not pick up Canal+ or any other pay stations. Instructions (TV only 
    in French) are in the maroon folder. Please keep noise from these appliances 
    down, especially if there are neighbours above or to the sides. Also, please 
    do not leave these electrical appliances on with the cupboard doors closed 
    (especially in very hot weather). 
</li>

<li>
	The <span class="bold">answering machine</span> has a pre-recorded message saying that we are 
    not there in French and English. By all means make use of the machine to receive 
    messages, but please do not re-record the answering message. To hear messages 
    (the light will be flashing), just press the large "MESSAGES" button. Please 
    do not erase, we will clear messages periodically by remote control. If necessary, 
    there are instructions (in French only) in the maroon folder.
</li>

<li> 
	A small <span class="bold">printer</span> (Olivetti JP192) has been left in the pine cupboard 
    (which we use as an office when we are here), together with a printer cable. 
    If you carry a laptop around with you (most fit neatly on the sliding shelf 
    of the cupboard) you are welcome to use the printer with it, but please replace 
    the cartridge if you do a lot of printing. 
</li>

<li>
	There is a large &quot;wheely-bin&quot; on the road outside of R&eacute;sidence 
    Horizon for disposing of <span class="bold">rubbish</span>, etc. This is emptied frequently.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span class="bold">Cleaning</span> materials are in the cupboard under the sink. Please leave 
    the apartment in the state that you found it (or if this was not wonderful, 
    in the state you would like to have found it!)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The use of <span class="bold">barbecues</span> or camping gas appliances is forbidden by the 
    Residents Association of R&eacute;sidence Horizon.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The <span class="bold">roller-shutter blinds</span> should not be closed too tightly and should 
    not be operated at too great an angle to the vertical. If they become difficult 
    to use, please report to M.Allias.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>When you arrive, the hardwood <span class="bold">parasol</span> should be dismantled inside 
    together with the patio furniture. To avoid the risk of damage, please do 
    not leave apartment or retire for the night without first letting down the 
    parasol and covering with plastic sleeve. The same applies in windy weather. 
    At the end of your stay, please dismantle, place in plastic sleeve and bring 
    inside. Please also bring inside if there is a storm or strong winds. If it 
    is raining, please do not leave the pole in the base - the wood swells and 
    it gets stuck.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <span class="bold">Terrace Awning:</span> This provides shade for the terrace in hot midsummer 
    weather. The terrace faces southwest and is in direct sun most of the day. 
    If the awning is let out before the sun heats up the terrace, it should remain 
    relatively cool during the heat of midday and early afternoon. Furthermore, 
    the awning traps in heat so that, should the evening get cool, it will still 
    be comfortable to use the terrace for evening meals, drinks or just sitting 
    watching the world go by. However, this is on the coast and, even in mid summer, 
    there is always the possibility of a sudden change in the weather. Therefore, 
    the awning must always be left in the closed position at night, at any time 
    when there is a risk of strong winds or whenever you leave the apartment. 
    To leave the awning out in strong winds would not only result in damage to 
    the awning but could also pose a risk to other people and property. Turn the 
    handle ant-clockwise to wind it out and clockwise to rewind it. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>To convert the <span class="bold">Sofa-bed</span>, first unzip and remove the cover and then 
    just lift up and pull out the front. To convert back, lift up the front until 
    it clicks and then simply push back, making sure the bar underneath locks. 
    If you can't get it, just go into any furniture store and ask a salesman to 
    demonstrate a "BZ". <br>
  </li>

<li>
	The internal walls are hollow and so make fixings difficult, please therefore 
    avoid excessive pressure, especially to the towel rail which we suspect people 
    have used to haul themselves out of the bath!
</li>

<li>
	The <span class="bold">Tide Clock </span>on the corner shelf in the lounge is only accurate 
    full moon to full moon. At other phases it can be out for up to 1½ hours but 
    is still a useful indicator. Please do not attempt to adjust it.
</li>

<li>
	There is a simple irrigation system to keep the terrace plants going if 
    the flat is empty. Please feel free to remove the unsightly converted plastic 
    water bottles when you arrive but put them back on and top them up before 
    you leave.
</li>

<li>
	The polystyrene block in the boot bench if for use with the beach umbrella 
    - put the pole through the block and bury the block in the sand to stop in 
    falling down.
</li>

<li>
	There is coloured tape at child height on the glass terrace sliding doors 
    to help prevent accidents. If you wish, you may remove this but please put 
    some more back in the same position before you go. There is a spare reel in 
    the draw opposite the fridge.
</li>

<li>
	A locked case above boiler contains paints and other substances, which might 
    be dangerous for children. Please do not touch this.
</li>

<li>
	A small species of wasp <span style="font-style:italic">(Fr. Guêpe)</span> seems to like either nesting 
    in or just visiting the tiles of the roof of the flat below. These seem to 
    be entirely harmless, but if you have a problem please let M. Allias know.
</li>

<li>
	Normal <span class="bold">postage </span>within France and to the UK is &euro;0.55 (letters or postcards, 
    2005). The nearest postbox is towards Plage de la Grande Côte, just 
    past L'Escale. There is a Post Office in St. Palais, opposite the Tourist 
    Office and the beach.
