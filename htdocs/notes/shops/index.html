<h1>Shops</h1>

<p align="center">(Tel nos. 05 46 23 xx xx unless stated otherwise)</p>
<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>
<p>The nearest shop is in the camping site about 100 metres up the road in the 
  direction of La Grande CÙte. This carries most grocery items etc. but unfortunately 
  is usually closed from 1 October to 31 April. Across the road is "Les Viviers 
  Charentais" which sells excellent fresh seafood (prepared as a take-away) as 
  well as other items. Adjacent to this they have a stall selling sandwiches and 
  hot and cold snacks to take away. In the winter they are only open at the weekends. 
  There is also a bread shop called Vincent which is open all summe.There are 
  other seasonal shops nearby. </p>
<p>Out of season you will need to go into St. Palais (about 1º miles) where there 
  are plenty of shops including a good self service store called "Casino" which 
  is like a mini supermarket. The market is open every day except Sunday (even 
  in winter) from 9am - 1pm selling the best local produce, including fresh sea-food. 
  The best days are usually Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Saturday. Locals say the best 
  bread shop is P.-J. et G. Flausse, though the one opposite the market is also 
  good when open. In season you need a disc to park in the blue parking areas 
  - most shops sell them for 15FRF (2000) and they last all year so please leave 
  behind for other visitors! </p>
<p>Cooking facilities in the kitchenette are limited which provides an ideal excuse 
  for the "cook" to take advantage of the many low cost take-away opportunities. 
  As well as "Les Viviers" opposite, there are several small shops in St. Palais 
  selling hot and cold take-away snacks. Our favourite, for roast chicken, is 
  "Rotisserie Saintongeaise" (Tel 11 99). </p>
<p>The nearest <b>supermarket</b> is CHAMPION on the north side of St. Palais 
  (just over a mile away via the D141). INTERMARCH… on this side of Royan is cheaper 
  and much more comprehensive and LECLERC on the Saintes road out of Royan is 
  bigger again. All are well signposted. The bar code fob on the key ring earns 
  you discounts in IntermarchÈ and points in Champion. Points mean prizes!</p>
<p>Royan (~3km) is a fairly big town with a very large selection of shops. </p>
<p>If you need to check your e-mail or access the internet for other reasons, 
  you can do this most days in a &quot;cber-cafe&quot; in St-Palais called &quot;benjinetshop&quot; 
  which is in the acade &quot;galerie ocÈane" in the centre of town (tel. 19 90 
  <a href="http://www.benjinetshop.com" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false">www.benjinetshop.com</a>). This provides 
  internet access from Ä2 and many other useful computer services including scanning 
  and printing. The owner speaks English and is good on software problems. Alternatively, 
  you can go to the France TÈlÈcom shop in the centre of Royan (parallel to Bd. 
  de la RÈpublique). If you do not have a France TÈlÈcom card, you can purchase 
  an FT phone card there and the staff will show you how to proceed. Another option 
  is the Post Office in Royan (end of Bd. de la RÈpublique), which has access 
  via cards. The cost (2002) is Ä7 to register (which includes1hour) and then 
  Ä4 per hour to top up your card. They are open 08.30 - 18.00 weekdays. </p>
<p>An interesting shop is "Albert et Fils" near the station in Royan. This sells 
  white goods (we bought the washing machine there), but if you ask you can also 
  buy excellent Bordeaux wines by the case. These are Chateau Turcaud, which is 
  owned by relatives of both this shop, and La Primavera (where the wines appear 
  on the wine list). Price about Ä65 per case (2005), Entre deux Mers and Bordeaux 
  Red or RosÈ. Excellent!
