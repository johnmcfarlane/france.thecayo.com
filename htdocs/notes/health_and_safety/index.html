<h1>Health and Safety</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 22.11.08 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Visitors are expected to use their common sense and to be aware of any obvious 
    hazards to be expected in a first floor apartment and in a seaside location. 
    The following list of potential problems should be regarded as illustrative 
    and is not intended to be comprehensive.</li>
  <li>The steps leading to the apartment can be slippery in wet weather.</li>
  <li>The "zebra" crossing is also slippery in wet weather!</li>
  <li>The rocks opposite the apartment are very sharp.</li>
  <li>Access can easily be gained to the roof below the terrace so make sure adventurous 
    children are supervised.The brackets holding the tiles in place are quite 
    sharp.</li>
  <li> A child once broke the glass in the sliding terrace doors by running onto 
    the terrace not realising that they were in the closed position.</li>
  <li>Items left on the terrace in stormy or windy weather are liable to be damaged 
    and create a dangerous situation if caught by a gust. Particular attention 
    is drawn to the parasol and to the terrace awning (if in use), which must 
    always be left in the closed position at night or when visitor are not in 
    the apartment.</li>
  <li>It is easy to knock your head on the cupboard doors in the kitchenette when 
    open.</li>
  <li>The toaster can be a fire risk and the sides are too hot to touch when 
    it is in use, so it should not be placed against other items. Baguettes or 
    other daily baked bread sticks are not suitable for toasting - they burn easily 
    and if dry can catch fire! The best bread for toasting is "pain compl<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&egrave;</span></font>te" or "pain six c<font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="EN-US">&eacute;</span></font>reals". 
	It is a good idea to knock out the crumbs regularly. 
  </li>
  <li>When replacing bulbs do not exceed maximum wattage (see chart enclosed with 
    spare bulbs in bathroom cupboard).</li>
  
  <li>There is a normal power point in bathroom unit (which would not be allowed 
    in the UK)</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Cleaning materials under the sink are potentially hazardous and should be 
    kept out of reach of children.&nbsp;<b style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></b><b style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style=""> </span></span></b><font size="-1"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="EN-US">The same applies to materials in the
bathroom cupboard above the wash basin.</span><b style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style=""></span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b></font><br>
