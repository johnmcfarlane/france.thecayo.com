<h1>On Arrival</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>
<p>Parking: Reserved parking is in space number 10.</p>
<p>Front Door: Unlocking is straightforward, though sometimes 
  you need to jiggle the key - it stiffens when not in regular use. (To lock, 
  first lift handle upwards and then turn key.) If the lock becomes difficult, 
  spray it with lock oil (found in the bathroom cupboard).</p>
<p>Electricity: The metal fuse box is on the wall by the 
  entrance door. If the electricity has been switched off, you will need to turn 
  on the main switch and the switches on the fuses for both Heating and Hot Water 
  (labelled). The latter is best set on night (a moon symbol) unless you are using 
  a lot of hot water during the day in which case switch temporarily to day (a 
  sun symbol). The night time rate (22.30 - 06.30) is almost half the price of 
  the day time rate.</p>
<p>There are spare fuses in a bottle in this cupboard. Spare light bulbs are to 
  be found in the bathroom cupboard. Should anyone need access to the mains control 
  and meter, this is situated in the second cupboard from the right, next to the 
  water cupboard downstairs (see below).</p>
<p>Unless there are visitors expected within a day or two of the previous tenants, 
  the fridge is normally defrosted, left empty and switched off with the door 
  open.</p>
<p>The three wall heaters, if required, have both an on/off switch (I/O) and a 
  thermostat control. When the heater is activated, a tiny red light can be seen 
  behind the controls. </p>
<p>There is a folder containing instructions for all appliances in the pine cupboard.</p>
<p>Water: If the water is off, there is a small tap 
  to the LHS of the base of the hot water tank in the cupboard and on to the 
  cistern of the toilet. If there is still no water, then the mains has been 
  turned off. </p>
<p>The mains stop cock is located in the third cupboard from the left at the bottom 
  of the stairs. You need a screwdriver (there is one in the fuse box cupboard) 
  to open the door. The tap and meter are clearly marked as No 8. </p>
<p>If there is a stale water/drains smell on entering the apartment, this is almost 
  certainly because water in a u-bend below the water tank has dried out. To replenish 
  the u-bend and eliminate this problem, turn the green lever below the tank a 
  couple of times.</p>
<p>The water is quite "hard " - if the kettle thermostat cuts out too soon, the 
  kettle needs de-scaling. Use 500 - 1000cc of ordinary white vinegar for this, 
  <b>not</b> other proprietary chemicals.</p>
<p>Visitors' Folder: This envelope folder contains a copy 
  of these notes, an inventory, a map of St. Palais, various brochures and 
  a copy of the current tide tables. Please leave all these for the benefit 
  of other visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if anything on the inventory is broken or missing.</p>
