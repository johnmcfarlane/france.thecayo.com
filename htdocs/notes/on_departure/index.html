<h1>On Departure</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>
<p>If other tenants are expected within the next 24 hours you may leave the electricity 
  and water turned on. Otherwise, please turn off the electricity at the fuse 
  box as well as the two fuse switches for hot water and heating.The water should 
  be turned off at the base of the hot water tank and at the toilet cistern. Unless 
  you know that there are other visitors within a few days, please also turn off 
  the stopcock in the water cupboard downstairs. </p>
<p>Please leave fridge defrosted well before you leave. </p>
<p>In case of bad weather and/or if no other visitors are due, please bring in 
  from the patio the hardwood parasol (the base can be left outside) and plastic 
  patio furniture and close all windows and shutters, especially the Terrace Awning. 
</p>
<p>In cold damp wintry weather, condensation can be a problem if the apartment 
  has been left empty for some time. The building has a ventilation system that 
  works best if <b>all the internal doors are left open </b>(ie bedroom, bathroom, 
  cupboard and WC). </p>
