<h1>Things to Bring</h1>

<p class="rev">Revision 25.02.06</p>
<p>Bed linen- sheets, duvet covers &amp; pillowcases. There 
  are single duvets for the bunk beds, one king size duvet, a double blanket 
  and a quilt.</p>
<p>The mattress sizes are 140x190 cms. (double bed), 90x190 cms. (bottom bunk 
  bed) and 80x190 cms. (top bunk bed). The pillows are all rectangular (UK style). 
</p>
<p>You can instead hire sheets from M. Allias at Auberge des Falaises at &euro;3.00 
  per pair of double sheets and &euro;2.40 per pair of single sheets (rates are per 
  week and include weekly change). </p>
<p>Towels &amp; Tea Towels - You can if you prefer, 
  hire towels from M. Allias at &euro;2.40 per bath towel and &euro;1.20 per hand towel 
  (rates are per week and include twice weekly change). </p>
<p> Phone Card The telephone (number (0)5 46 23 07 41) is 
  for incoming calls and for outgoing local calls, so gusets can book restaurants, 
  enquire as to whether various attractions are open, etc. Local calls extend 
  as far as La Rochelle and Saintes. If dialing out with a BT Chargecard, dial 
  0800 99 02 44 first. </p>
<p>There is also a telephone answering machine which visitotrs may use but please 
  do not change the message..</p>
<p>Binoculars - to look at the passing boats, etc.</p>
<p><b>Electric plug adapters</b> for any UK equipment you 
  bring with you (eg radio, electric hair things, etc.). If you have an electric 
  shaver or electric toothbrush, you will also need a shaver point adaptor because 
  the shaver point in the bathroom is for a standard continental plug. Note - 
  some electrical equipment is supplied (see below). </p>
<p><b>Beach Footwear -</b> the limestone rocks opposite 
  the apartment are quite sharp so a pair of suitable synthetic sandals is useful, 
  especially with thick rubber soles. You can buy just the thing locally in St 
  Palais. </p>
<p><b>Tea bags</b> - If you like strong tea, you might have 
  difficulty finding a brand to suit your taste locally. However, other British 
  visitors tend to bring more than they need so there is usually a stock of bags 
  in one of the plastic containers. </p>
<p><b>Some items</b> that you might think 
  to bring are available in the apartment for the use of tenants. These include 
  2 folding beach chairs, 2 sun loungers for use on terrace only, a small aluminium 
  &amp; plastic parasol light enough to carry to the beach, a picnic cool box, a hair-drier, 
  an electric iron, a TV and a new hifi system which plays cassettes and CD's. 
  However, the latter does not receive long wave (BBC Radio 4 is on 198kHZ) - 
  if you want to listen to The Archers you should bring a decent portable radio; 
  reception is quite good on the breakfast bar with a power point nearby). See 
  <a href="../../details/inventory">inventory</a> for full list of apartment contents. </p>
