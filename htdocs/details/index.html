<p>
	The apartment is ideal for two or for a small family. 
	The two bunk beds are full size. 
	In the summer the terrace gives you an extra room. 
	We like to eat there, or just to sit with a drink and watch the world go by. 
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="../pictures/apartment_views">sea view</a> is great and full of interest; 
	large boats including the occasional cruise liner can be seen on their way to and from Bordeaux. 
	There is a lot of fishing activity to watch. 
	At night the famous lighthouse (Phare de Cordouan) can be clearly seen on the sand banks in the distance. 
</p>

<p>
	The apartment is fully equipped but you have to bring your own bed linen and towels (see 
	<a href="../notes">Notes</a>
	for Visitors for details). 
	There is a cooker (4 rings), a microwave/grill, a full size refrigerator with an ice compartment and a new washing machine. 
	See also <a href="new2002">New since 2002</a> for more up to date information.
</p>

<p>
	There are electric heaters in the bedroom, bathroom and lounge if you need them out of season.
